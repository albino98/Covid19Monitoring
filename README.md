# Covid19Monitoring

This is a small Python project for Covid19 monitoring. I used Python with Flask, MySql and Plotly library for graphs.

The data used are those present at the following link: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc

**_The whole project (including DB and tasks) is hosted on PythonAnyWhere at the following link:_ http://alby98.pythonanywhere.com/**

Plotly documentation: https://plotly.com/python/

The project consists of a database that contains the data to be displayed, a single web page and python that takes care of retrieving the data from the API, inserting them into the database and displaying them in the graphs through the Plotly library.


# Code
https://github.com/albino98/Covid19Monitoring/tree/main/covid19Monitoring

Note that there is no python virtual env folder in the code repository, so you will need to create one. I used python 3.6.2. (https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html#env-requirements)

For the database create a new database named covid19 and import the file covid19.sql in the code folder. The database already contains some data.


# Donations

If you liked the project, offer me a coffee!
