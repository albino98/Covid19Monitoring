# Covid19Monitoring

This is a small Python project for Covid19 monitoring. I used Python with Flask, MySql and Plotly library for graphs.

The data used are those present at the following link: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc

The whole project (including DB and tasks) is hosted on PythonAnyWhere at the following link: http://alby98.pythonanywhere.com/

Plotly documentation: https://plotly.com/python/

The project consists of a task (executed once a day with the specific PythonAnyWhere functionality) which retrieves the data via api and inserts them into the database.

The website instead consists of a single web page that allows you to select the data to be displayed, then python retrieves the data present on the db and finally the Plotly library generates the graphs.
